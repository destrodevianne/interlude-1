!Trader Zenkin:

Ahh, Welcome! This is the most conscientious shop located on the north side of Aden.

There is some ridiculous rumor going around that I, Trader Zenkin, am a wanted man, or that I am actually a Timak Orc in disguise! Gossipers should all be killed! Don't you agree? Right!

Anyway, open your eyes and look carefully, these aren't normal items!
