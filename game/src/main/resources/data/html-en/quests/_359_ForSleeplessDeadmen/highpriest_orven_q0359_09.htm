High Priest Orven:

Oh, Einhasad! Here are your children. Their last battle has been won.

Take them into your arms, into the world of the dead.

Release them from their bonds and receive them into the bosom of Shilen.

Give them eternal rest and happiness in your light.

For those who grieve these brave warriors still, dry your tears, for now your loved ones are at peace...
