High Priest Orven:

I feel the agony of their souls, being forced to fight their brothers... Such noble warriors deserve a peaceful rest...

The immortal heroes of Aden must be freed from this evil enslavement! Would you recover their remains and bring them here, to the Temple of Einhasad? You will find them among the *doom archers, doom guards and doom servants* in the Fields of Massacre near the *Devastated Castle*.

[Quest _359_ForSleeplessDeadmen quest_accept|"I will bring you the remains of the heroes."]
