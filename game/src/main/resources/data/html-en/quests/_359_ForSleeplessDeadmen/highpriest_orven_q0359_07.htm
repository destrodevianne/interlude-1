High Priest Orven:

The Devastated Castle is northeast of here. There are many restless souls haunting that area. You'll find *doom archers*, *doom guards*,  and *doom servants*. Bring back *60 of their remains*. Beware the doom knights, doom warriors and doom troopers who patrol there. They are former soldiers of Elmore. They won't let you free their minions easily...
