High Priest Orven:

These noble warriors made the ultimate sacrifice and successfully defended the castle from the enemy! There is no more honorable way to die, but their poor souls have not received any proper recognition... No Glory of Einhasad... Not even a Rest of Shilen, which is given to all! This is a long story... Are you sure you want to hear it?
