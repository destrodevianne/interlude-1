High Priest Orven:

In the time of Raul the Unification King, Gustav Ken Vennerheim fought a bloody battle for the castle. After 130 days of pitched combat, he was slain without ever fulfilling his goal.

But now it seems that even death cannot stop his spirit! He has formed an alliance with the forces of darkness and returned as an undead. He has raised an army of the dead, among them our own warriors who died defending the castle against him! He is attempting to take the Devastated Castle again!
