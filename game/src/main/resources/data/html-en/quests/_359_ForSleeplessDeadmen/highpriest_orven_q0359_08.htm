High Priest Orven:

The purification ritual is over.

I found a gemstone that was sparkling with a holy light. I think it must have been used by one of the fallen heroes of the castle.

Perhaps they left it for you! Yes, I think they did! Why don't you take it?

There are still many of our fallen comrades out there who have not been put to rest. If you want to help, come back and see me again.
